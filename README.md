# Rusted realm [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dmarcuse/rusted_realm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dmarcuse/rusted_realm)

Rusted realm is an experimental project to implement a standalone native client for Realm of the Mad God.
Right now, effort is concentrated on libraries tackling specific behavior needed for this, which will later be used by the client.
